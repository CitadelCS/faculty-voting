faculty-voting is a program desgined for mutiple users to make and vote in specified groups.

As a new user first you must sign up using your email and a password of your choice. Next you will need to enter your information into the program as a user, click on program users and put a name and role. Under the roles tab pick what role you are in as user. The program by default has the roles group 1 and 2, but more can be added using the groups button. If proposals active or archived gives a nil error it is beacuse you have no roles or program users and must create them. Once you have your users and roles you can create a proposal with a name and description. It will then be moved to active proposals. When the proposal is done the creator can click the checkbox available to mark it finished and it moves to archived proposals. Proposals, role and program users can all be edited after the fact. 

Program Dependencies: None
